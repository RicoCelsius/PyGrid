# PyGrid Binance grid bot

Use at your own risk! I'm not a professional coder and I'm doing this project just for fun.

Only for Binance!

Installation steps:
1. Clone this repo
2. Use the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to install the requirements.
3. Configure the config.py file
4. Make sure you pay trading fees with BNB, else the bot will get stuck eventually. (still need to fix a bug lol).
5. Use the command "python3 run.py" to start the bot.


Bug reports will be appreciated.
