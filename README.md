# PyGrid Binance grid bot

Use at your own risk! I'm not a professional coder and I'm doing this project just for fun.

Only for Binance!

Installation steps:
1. Clone this repo
2. Use the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to install the requirements.
3. Configure the config.py file to your liking.
4. Make sure you pay trading fees with BNB, else the bot will get stuck eventually.
5. Use the command "python3 run.py" to start the bot.

Tip: Use PM2 to manage the process.


Bug reports will be appreciated.

Upcoming features:
- Telegram messages
- Compounding
- Slow mode -> this means no extra buy orders will be created when price moves up and fills sell orders.
- BNB buy mode -> Bot will buy more BNB when there is almost no BNB left in your wallet to pay fees
- Complete refactoring of code
